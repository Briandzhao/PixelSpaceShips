# PixelSpaceShips
October 2018. 2D browser game I made during fall quarter of my freshman year at UCI. I worked on this from 10/2018 to 12/2018.
The complete game can be played at https://squarecircle.itch.io/pixel-space-ships
This game makes heavy use of object oriented programming for ships and particles. It features responsive ship AI, particle systems for explosions and trails, and sound effects using the Woof JS library. It uses state machine logic to manage the various menus and levels.
